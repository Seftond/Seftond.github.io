										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I am a software engineer specializing in front end web development using the React framework. I grew up working as a trim carpenter. This trade forced me to gain a strict attention to detail that I try to bring to my work. In my free time, I enjoy watching, playing and analyzing sports. While watching sports, I fell in love with the idea that a team could get an edge by "outsmarting" their opponent. This love has guided me to the world of programming, where I can manipulate large sets of data in a consistent format and share the results with millions of people in a beautiful way. I look forward to getting my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and utilizing it to continue the quest to modernize sports and create better business solutions.</p>

															<h4>Devmountain- Web Development</h4>
															<p><i>~Graduated May 2022</i></p>
														<p>
															Completed a 16 week full-time web development bootcamp. The bootcamp consists of two 
															seperate 8 week sections. The first section is designed to create 
															a well rounded foundation in coding. In keeping with this goal, 
															the foundations course teaches everything needed to create a 
															web application using vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS. The foundations 
															course also teaches a small amount of data analytics using python,
															QA and testing, and cryptogrophy. The second half of the course promotes a 
															specialization in web development using React with the final outcome being 
															the ability to create a full-stack application using React.
